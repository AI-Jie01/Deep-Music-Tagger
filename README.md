# Deep Music Classifier

Project mostly based on [Dec 2016.] [Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Music Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04243) (Keunwoo Choi, George Fazekas, Mark Sandler, Kyunghyun Cho), i.e. using convolutional recurrent neural network deep model for multi-output classification task (tagging each music piece using a subset of labels).
